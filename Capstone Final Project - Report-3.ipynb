    "Opening a new restaurant is a challenging endeavour. Lots of financial and material resources need to be invested. After the opening, fixed as well as variable costs need to be covered; also, the initial investments need to be amortized after a certain time frame. To achieve this, the owner or manager of a restaurant can adjust many aspects of the restaurant, e.g. \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>pricing of the food and beverages served,</li>\n",
    "<li>quality of the food and beverages served,</li>\n",
    "<li>furniture, style and ambience of the interior,</li>\n",
    "<li>staff (e.g. chef, waiter/waitress),</li>\n",
    "<li>different types of marketing (e.g. paid, owned, and earned media),</li>\n",
    "<li>and others.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "However, one crucial aspect cannot be changed so easily: location. Thus, picking the right location is vital for success. Specifically, location determines a restaurant's success with regards to two aspects:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>customer potential</li>\n",
    "    <li>competition</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<b><i>Customer potential</i></b> refers to the reachable target market, i.e. those people a restaurant can realistically expect to reach and convert into customers. People can physically reach a restaurant by public transport, by bicycle, or simply by foot. The farther people live or work away from a restaurant, the more effort the need to put into getting there. Thus, the more they need to be convinced, or \"persuaded\", to go there. Consequently, in an ideal situation, a restaurant is located at a spot that already is highly frequented by potential customers, e.g. a location where many pedestrians pass anyway.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "<b><i>Competition</i></b> refers to alternative options for potential customer to serve their needs. In the case of a restaurant, direct competition refers to other restaurants. The more restaurants are located nearby a new restaurant, the stiffer the competition. In addition, the type of other restaurant matters. For example, if there are many restaurants nearby, but all offering other type of cuisine, e.g. none of them Italian, this could still be an opportunity for a new Italian restaurant.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "The business problem for this capstone project is defined as follows:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>An Italian restaurant chain wants to open a new Italian restaurant in NYC</li>\n",
    "    <li>The chain's management is uncertain where the best location would be</li>\n",
    "    <li>The management is aware that many aspects determine the success of the new restaurant</li>\n",
    "    <li>The management however wants to be assisted with finding promising locations by specifically focusing on two aspects: 1) <i>customer potential</i> and 2) <i>competition</i></li>\n",
    "    <li>The management wants to be provided with a list of attractive locations they can further narrow down using other aspects that are not disclosed at the moment</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "First, for the dataset on NYC pedestrian counts, the following steps were taken:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>comparing the actual downloaded data with its description of the website - results:</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>114 pedestrian counters are listed (checked via Pandas dataframe)</li>\n",

    "        <li>for each counter, the pedestrian volume is provided for one weekday in May and September, divided into AM and PM, and a Saturday with pedestrian volume for the second half of the day only (checked via Pandas data frame)</li>\n",
    "        <li>the data is provided for a 10-year time period (2007 to 2017, checked via Pandas dataframe)</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "As part of pre-processing the data, ...\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>the mean of weekday PM May, Saturday May and weekday PM September and Saturday September was calculated for each pedestrian counter, considering the last 3 available years (i.e. 2015-2017)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "        \n",
    "Second, regarding the Foursquare data, ...\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>for each of the 114 pedestrian counters, the number of available restaurants or \"food places\" overall as well of specifically Italian restaurants was obtained for the vicinity of 300 meters around each counter; this was done by using two different venue IDs</li>\n",
    "    <li>plausibility of the data was assessed by checking actual numbers of restaurants (\"Does the magnitude seem reasonable?\") and by comparing the total number of restaurants with that of specifically Italian restaurants (Number of Italian restaurants always being a subset of and thus smaller number than that of total restaurants)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "Third, the input data for cluster analysis was normalized by obtaining the difference of each value from the column mean and dividing it by the standard deviation of the column (so-called Z transformation, see columns Zrestaurants, Zitalianrestaurants, and Zfrequency in notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>3.2 Conducting cluster analysis</h3>\n",
    "Kmeans was chosen as clustering method. After an initial 5-cluster solution did not provide completely different 5 clusters, a 3-cluster solution was chosen. Such smaller number of clusters seems also reasonable as there are only 114 cases to be assigned to the different clusters. Cluster analysis was chosen to identify different groups of areas where a new restaurant could be opened. Each of these groups represents a different combination of customer potential and competition."
